Site-wide markup validator. Validate a whole web site on the W3C Markup Validator, from the command line, and generate a comprehensive report of all errors found.

This is the command-line version of http://markupvalidator.com

= Installation:

site_validator is a Ruby gem that can be installed on the usual way

  gem install site_validator

= Usage:

Pass it a starting URL to be checked, and the filename where you want your report to be generated, like:

  site_validator http://ryanair.com/sitemap.xml report.html

This will validate all the internal URLs found on the starting URL, up to a maximum of 250 URLs, and generate an HTML file with the full report.

You can pass site_validator an XML sitemap or the URL of a website; it will scrape it in search of URLs to validate.

= Timeouts:

By default, the site_validator gem will set a 20 seconds timeout for each individual request. If you want to set a different timeout, pass it as a third parameter like this:

  site_validator http://ryanair.com/sitemap.xml report.html 60

= Using an alternate validation server

By default, the site_validator gem will use the official W3C Validator server at http://validator.w3.org but you can use an alternate server if you want.
To do this, define an environment variable on your machine, like:

  ENV['W3C_MARKUP_VALIDATOR_URI'] = 'http://example.com/validator'

Follow this guide to know how to setup your own validation server: https://github.com/tlvince/w3c-validator-guide

= Notes:

This gem requires Ruby 1.9, and has been tested on Ruby 1.9.2-p0
